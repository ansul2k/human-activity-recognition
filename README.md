# human-activity-recognition
Predicting activity that occurs in a smart home being observed by the ambient sensors.

Data is collected continuously while residents perform their normal routines.
Ambient PIR motion sensors, door/temperature sensors, and light switch sensors are placed throughout the home of the volunteer. 
The sensors are placed in locations throughout the home that are related to specific activities of daily living that we
wish to capture.
